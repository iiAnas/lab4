                Mecca, officially Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: مكة المكرمة‎, romanized: Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah the Noble') and commonly shortened to Makkah,[a] is the holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Mecca Province of Saudi Arabia.[2] The city
                is 70 km (43 mi) inland from Jeddah on the Red Sea, in a narrow valley 277 m (909 ft) above sea level. Its last recorded population was 1,578,722 in 2015.[3] The estimated metro population in 2020 is 2.042 million, making it the third-most
                populated city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Jeddah. Pilgrims more than triple this number every year during the Ḥajj pilgrimage, observed in the twelfth Hijri month of Dhūl-Ḥijjah.

                Mecca is the birthplace of Muhammad. The Hira cave atop the Jabal al-Nur ("Mountain of Light") is just outside the city and is where Muslims believe the Quran was first revealed to Muhammad.[4] Visiting Mecca for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able
                Muslims. The Great Mosque of Mecca, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and Ishmael, is one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims (qibla),
                cementing Mecca's significance in Islam.
            </p>

                Muslim rulers from in and around the region long tried to take the city and keep it in their control, and thus, much like most of the Hejaz region, the city has seen several regime changes. The city was finally conquered in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz
                by Ibn Saud and his allies in 1925. Since then, Mecca has seen a tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure, with newer, modern buildings such as the Abraj Al Bait, the world's fourth-tallest building and third-largest by floor area,
                towering over the Great Mosque. The Saudi government has also carried out the destruction of several historical structures and archaeological sites, such as the Ajyad Fortress. Non-Muslims (Kuffar) are strictly prohibited from entering
                the city.

            <p>Etymology Mecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, its etymology is obscure.[15] Widely believed to be a synonym for Makkah, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley located therein, while
                Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the Ka'bah.

                Makkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca In South Arabic, the language in use in the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula at the time of Muhammad, the b and m were interchangeable. This is presumed to have been the origin of the current form of the
                name. "Makkah" is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is closer to the Arabic pronunciation.[21][22] The government adopted Makkah as the official spelling in the 1980s, but is not universally known or used worldwide.[21]
                The full official name is Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: مكة المكرمة‎, romanized: Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah the Honored'). "Makkah" is used to refer to the city in the Quran in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse 24.
            </p>
            <p> The word "Mecca" in English has come to be used to refer to any place that draws large numbers of people, and because of this some English-speaking Muslims have come to regard the use of this spelling for the city as offensive.[21] Nonetheless,
                Mecca is the familiar form of the English transliteration for the Arabic name of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                The consensus in academic scholarship is that "Macoraba", the place mentioned in Arabia Felix by Claudius Ptolemy, is Mecca. Many etymologies have been proposed but the most suitable one is that it is derived from the Old South Arabian root "M-K-R-B"
                which means temple.
            </p>

                Other names: Another name used for Mecca in the Quran is at 6:92 where it is called Umm al-Qurā[26] (أُمّ ٱلْقُرَى, meaning "Mother of all Settlements".[23] The city has been called several other names in both the Quran and ahadith. Another name used
                historically for Mecca is Tihāmah.[27] According to Arab and Islamic tradition, another name for Mecca, Fārān, is synonymous with the Desert of Paran mentioned in the Old Testament at Genesis 21:21. Arab and Islamic tradition holds that
                the wilderness of Paran, broadly speaking, is the Tihamah coastal plain and the site where Ishmael settled was Mecca.[28] Yaqut al-Hamawi, the 12th century Syrian geographer, wrote that Fārān was "an arabized Hebrew word, one of the names
                of Mecca mentioned in the Torah."
